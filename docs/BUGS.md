# Open findings — the holding pen

**What this file is.** EVERY bug goes here. A bug found while working an item does not derail the
item and does not get chased on the spot: it is written down, with what was measured and where it
was seen, and the item carries on (Law 10: one ordered list, one item at a time; Law 11: a
misbehaving number is not a work item, the missing mechanism is).

**The one thing fixed on the spot** is a violation that STOPS THE BUILD: an impossible quantity, a
one-sided flow, a fact with two writers. The engine refuses to run past those, so they are fixed
where they are — and written down here as well, marked RESOLVED.

**What happens to it.** When the item closes, every finding here is POSITIONED: moved into the
`docs/plan/<item>.md` of the item that should fix it, or inserted as an item of its own at its
dependency position, with the record saying where it landed and why. A finding is deleted from this
file only by being placed — never by being decided against without a line in `docs/RECORD.md`.

**This file is temporary.** When it is empty it goes.

## Found while working item 12a

### 12a-1 — The equity index reads a level its own prints do not make

**Where.** `audit/families/cross-market.ts` (the `crossMarket` family), against the `indices`
module's `equity.us`. Seen with `rigWorld('reporting', 4, 40)`.

**Measured.** Green for twenty-four periods, then from period 25 on, every period:

```
crossMarket: equity.us reads 7860.8928192012245 where its own prints make 7864.660507830988
p26 onwards: 7837.44881897073 against 7841.20527100242
```

A gap of about five parts in ten thousand, appearing at one period and then carried unchanged —
which is the same SHAPE as 12-18 (a step, not a drift) and rules out accumulating dust.

**Not this item's, and not caused by it.** Item 12a adds an append-only ledger of equity moves, one
extracted balance-sheet read, and a module that writes journal events. None of them touches a price,
a print or an index; the world runs identically with the reporting phase removed. The likeliest
cause is 11.5: the equity float moved from the desks to the savers, and a free-float weighting is a
read of who holds what — so an index that weighs by float now weighs by a different set of holders,
and something in the level and something in the constituents disagree about which set.

**Where it belongs.** With the equity book, which is worklist **12c**: the index is a read of the
same book that item is about, and a level that disagrees with its own constituents is the same class
of defect as a print that disagrees with what was paid for it. To be positioned when 12a closes.
