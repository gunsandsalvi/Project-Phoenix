# The record

A ledger of outcomes, not a diary (Law 16). One entry per worklist item, written when the item
closes: what changed, why, what was found, what it deleted. A forecast appears only next to the
measurement that would kill it (Law 17).

---

## 0 — Foundation

**What.** Repository scaffold: TypeScript strict, npm workspaces (`packages/engine`, `packages/app`,
`tools`), ESLint with five project rules (no bounds, no numeric defaults, no magic numbers, no kind
branches, no clock or randomness), Vitest with fast-check, Playwright smoke test, GitHub Actions for
CI, Pages and a Capacitor Android APK. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` records every implementation decision
with the clause it derives from. `CLAUDE.md` carries the rules digest into every session. The spec
moved to `docs/spec/PROJECT_PHOENIX.md`; `tools/spec-index.ts` parses it (1,739 nodes, 1,317 of them
REASON/VERIFY/FORBID) and `tools/check-citations.ts` fails the build on a citation that does not
resolve.

**Why.** Law 14 and Appendix C need a place where every change says what and why; Law 2 and XI-14
need every number declared; Law 6 and Appendix A need bounds and defaults to be impossible to write
by accident.

**Decisions taken here** (all in ARCHITECTURE.md): doubles with derived dust, not integer minor
units; money as an instrument; the worker boundary as the observer surface's physical form.

## 1 — Money and settlement, one calendar

**What.** `core/`, `calendar/`, `ledger/`. Money is an instrument issued by a bank or central bank;
an account is a holding of it. Every state change is a numbered instruction with two named sides per
leg; settlement applies all legs or none and generates the interbank reserve leg itself. A payment
across issuers is that money's redemption at the first issuer and issuance at the second; money whose
issuer is the central bank changes holder and is never redeemed by a transfer. Creation and
destruction happen only through an issuer's own account. Fails are recorded, never half-settled. One
calendar with 7-day periods and 5 cycles; periodicities placed by date; four day counts.

**Found.** The audit found two settlement defects before any test did: a redeem leg emitted on the
central bank's money when the payer's issuer was the central bank (money "vanished" from the CB's
stock while its holdings stood), and the issuer's liability not re-marked when two holders traded at
a price away from the previous mark (world equity was not zero-sum by the trade's realised loss).
Both fixed at the cause: the routing rule and the issuer-side effect of a holder-to-holder credit.

## 2 — Register, clearing, cells, delivery-versus-payment, value, parameter register

**What.** `register/`, `clearing/`, `prices/`, `parties/`, `world/`, `audit/`, `observer/`. Holdings
with FIFO lots and liens, both directions indexed. Cells store per-member state; a leg on a cell is
denominated per member at the weight it was struck; split and merge are exact; weights move by five
events only. One solver: uniform price at the posted price executing the most volume, pro rata at
the margin, outcomes `cleared | noDemand | noSupply | noOverlap`, never a bracket. Markets settle each
trade as one instruction (paper one way, cash the other) and print with provenance; a market nobody
posts into prints stale, visibly. Value is units × price at read; carrying value is derived from lot
basis, acquisition period and the price store (nothing stored beside units). Revaluation books mark
changes to holders and the reverse to issuers. Equity is a stated account per party moved only by
settlement effects and revaluation; the accounts family compares it to assets minus liabilities.
Seven audit families built, two report themselves as not built. The foundation seed (one currency,
one region, a central bank, a treasury, two banks, three firms, four household cells, one benchmark
line) passes the audit at period zero and stays green over a year with coupons flowing.

**Found.** Per-member and total quantities were mixed in the seed's equity read and the accounts
family (both divided a per-member figure by the weight); fixed by making every party's accounting
per member of that party. The single-currency guard in settlement (`Money A2.b`) stands until the
currency layer exists (worklist 12) and is declared there.

**Placeholders.** One: `seed.openingPrice.gov.north.2036`, standing in for the auction (worklist 3).

**Forecast, with its killer.** The `flows` and `money` families will fail the period a mechanism
writes a holding outside settlement; if a year of stepping with coupons ever passes with such a write
unreported, the families are not independent reads and must be rebuilt.
